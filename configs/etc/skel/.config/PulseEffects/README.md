# Installation
Just copy the `.preset` files into the `PulseEffects` directory you can find in the local `config` directory. Obviously the location of that directory depends on how you installed PulseEffects. If you installed it through Flatpak, you can find it in `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects/config/PulseEffects`, or if you used the PPA for Ubuntu (or the AUR package for Arch) it should be `~/.config/PulseEffects`
